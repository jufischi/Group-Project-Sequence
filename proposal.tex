\begin{abstract}
In \cite{mckenna_whole-organism_2016}, the authors modify the genome of a zebra
fish embryo to contain a known sequence of CRISPR targets. After some time, the
authors triggered random mutations in this sequence in the embryo. Finally, they examined the
resulting differences to the original sequence and created a
binary barcode for each cell. Using this and the Camin-Sokal-Parsimony approach,
the authors tried to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree to reveal the lineage of
each embryonic cell. We want to reproduce those trees using the original data in
Python.
